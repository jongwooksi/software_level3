     FADE IN...

     A sun-blasted sky. We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after
     another...

     We're --

1    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

     Cars are at a standstill. It's a horrific traffic jam.

     Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the
     heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the
     distance.

     We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after
     another...

     One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another
     sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We
     move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO,
     until finally we begin to hear...

     ...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN]

     We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing.
     The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on
     her radio -- then starts SINGING.

     Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the
     lane.

     One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING
     along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL-
     FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER...

     Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making
     use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms
     swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts.
     We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars,
     taking the magic in...

     Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles --
     and the song comes to a dramatic stop.

     Flash title card:

                              WINTER

A1   We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is
     SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's
     playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious
     Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". But he keeps stopping it, over
     and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot.
                              Revision                           2.


B1   OMIT

C1   We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. A light-green
     2005 Prius. Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. Six years of
     "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer.
     She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system.
     Fast, fiery, full of energy --

                            MIA
               ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked.
               It was pure insanity.

     Mia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... Then
     leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger
     seat. It's a SCRIPT.

                            MIA (CONT'D)
                      (reading now)
               Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...

     Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. She's
     too focused on her lines to notice.

     Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT.

     Mia comes to. Jerked back to reality. The honking car behind
     her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him
     the finger. We then FOLLOW her as she drives...

4    INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as --

                            CUSTOMER #1
               This doesn't taste like almond milk.

                            MIA
               Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --

                            CUSTOMER #1
               Can I see the carton?

     Mia hands it over. The Customer looks.

                            CUSTOMER #1 (CONT'D)
               I'll have a black coffee.

     Mia gets the coffee. Quickly sneaks a look at a script hidden
     underneath her counter. The same one we saw in her car...
                               Revision                          3.


    She hands the coffee to the Customer. We follow the Customer
    out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. We
    don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the
    shop turn immediately to her. We see one CUSTOMER whisper to
    another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by...

                           WOMAN
              Cappuccino, please.

    Mia nods. Gets it made. The Manager takes it from her.

                           MANAGER
              On us.

                           WOMAN
              No, I insist.

    She pays. Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar.
    Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO
    EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop
    is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away...

    Then -- Mia's phone rings. It reads: "MOM". Mia presses
    "IGNORE" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07.

                           MIA
              Shit.

    Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as --

                           MANAGER
              Where do you think you're going?

                           MIA
              It's -- five past...

                           MANAGER
              You'd better be here early tomorrow.

                           MIA
              Ok.

    -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to
    grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. Coffee
    and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're --

5   INT. AUDITION ROOM - DAY

    Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. On
    her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges --

                           MIA (CONT'D)
              And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It
              was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...
                                Revision                      4.


    Her nerves are practically visible. As she talks, we PULL
    BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR.

                           MIA (CONT'D)
              No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you
              waiting `til Denver to tell her...?
                     (as her smile contracts)
              Oh. I see...
                     (silence; she clenches her jaw...)
              No, you're right. I understand.
                     (...and a tear falls from her eye)
              Ok... I just... Oh...

    An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind
    Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. Can I come in?

                           MIA (CONT'D)
                     (crying now)
              No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --

                            CASTING DIRECTOR
              One second.

    Mia stops. The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. The
    Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. Mia stands
    there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as
    the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks.

                           CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
              ...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost
              done in here.

    The Assistant nods. Walks out. Mia waits, trying to maintain...

                           CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
              You know what? I think we're good. Thanks
              for coming in.

    Mia looks at her. A beat.

6   INT. LOBBY - DAY

    Mia exits. Nerves still on edge. Passes one beautiful redhead
    after the next -- all getting ready to cry.

    Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque.
    Also redheads.

7   INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

    Mia enters. Exhausted. Heads to her ROOM.
                             Revision                          5.


    Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid
    Bergman one over the bed. There's also a shelf filled with
    acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. Various other
    trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. Mia
    takes off her shoe. A blister on her sole.

8   WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a
    towel. She hums to herself.

    The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on
    the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the
    lights. Looks...

    With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those
    soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes
    her hair...

    Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken.

                           TRACY
              Holy Mother of God.

    Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27.

                           TRACY (CONT'D)
              Ever heard of a vent?

                           MIA
              I wanted to give you an entrance.

                           ALEXIS
                     (appearing in the hall, 26,
                      eating Cheetos)
              Mia! How'd it go?

                           MIA
              Eh...

                           ALEXIS
              Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

                           MIA
              I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.

                           ALEXIS
              They're the worst.

                           MIA
              I don't know if they were there.

    As Mia slips away --

                           ALEXIS
              I bet they were.
                               Revision                           6.


                            CAITLIN
                      (appearing, 27)
               Why is there a convention in the bathroom?

                            TRACY
               Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming,
               right?

     WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom --

                            MIA
               Can't. Working.

                             TRACY (O.S.)
               What?
                      (we PAN BACK to Tracy)
               Did she say "working"?

A8   We follow Mia INSIDE her room. She closes the door. Takes a
     moment. You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on
     the town is the last thing she wants to do now.

B8   WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door.

                             MIA
                       (opening up)
               Yes?

                            TRACY
               Look, I know things didn't go well today.
               There are four things in my inbox that
               you're perfect for and I will submit you.
               But right now -- you're coming.

C8   With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet --

                            TRACY (CONT'D)
               It'll be fun.

                            MIA
               It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed
               into one of those glass houses.

                            TRACY
               Exactly. Fun.

     She pulls out a blue dress. As Alexis hurries in --

            TRACY (CONT'D)                        MIA
     This looks familiar.             I was going to give it
                                      back!

     Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as
     she grabs it --
                               Revision                           7.


                             ALEXIS
                Come on, Mia. When else do you get to
                see every Hollywood cliche crammed
                into a single home?

                             TRACY
                       (faux-offended)
                Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's
                nothing to make fun of. This party will
                be humanity at its finest.

      Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that --

      Tracy BREAKS INTO SONG. [SOMEONE IN THE CROWD]

      She play-acts the cliches this party will represent. Alexis
      and Caitlin join in, giddy and playful. Mia can't help but
      laugh. The roommates sing and dance, hoping to persuade Mia
      to join the night's revelry...

      Mia remains reluctant. Stays behind in her room as her
      roommates head out the door. But she's starting to wonder: A
      night at home, feeling sorry for herself -- or a night out
      with her friends...?

9     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING / STREET - NIGHT

      We're outside now, and BACK with Tracy, Alexis and Caitlin,
      marching across the courtyard and toward the street. They
      sing, dance, half-assuming Mia is a no-go --

      -- until Mia APPEARS, blue-dress-clad. Her roommates look at
      her in surprise -- then delight. The energy swells and the
      four characters dance their way together down the street.
      They dive into a single CAR, and WE DISSOLVE TO...

10    OMIT.

A10   OMIT.

11    EXT. CITY - NIGHT

      An old-fashioned MONTAGE of a night on the town: neon signs
      and overflowing champagne glasses. Soon enough, we're at...

12    EXT. MODERN HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT

      Valet cars lined up. We FOLLOW Alexis, Tracy, Caitlin and Mia
      to the door...

13    INT./EXT. HILLTOP HOUSE - NIGHT

      ...and into a big-glass hilltop pad. We FOLLOW Mia as she
      takes in her surroundings.
                                 Revision                          8.


      A D.J. turning tables. A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a
      TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in
      rhythm by the bar. Yep -- every cliche is here...

      Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch
      her.

      Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her.

      She makes a hasty exit toward the bar -- but the line's
      obscenely long.

      She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way,
      making out.

      She slips in behind them...

A13   Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. The joy of seconds
      ago is gone from her eyes now. She gazes into the mirror --

      -- and SINGS by herself.

      This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less
      brash, and far more vulnerable...

      Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once
      again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the
      crowd...

B13   We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but
      everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving
      in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the
      pain underneath the cliches...

      Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the
      splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE
      SNOW falling from above...

      As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps --

      -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL.

      This is the climax of the number. Everyone joins in,
      circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky.
      Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes
      with a blast of fireworks.

A14   EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Close on a sign: "NO PARKING ANYTIME: TOW-AWAY ZONE".
                                  Revision                      9.


                             MIA (O.S.)
                No...

      We see Mia -- all alone, staring at the sign. No car in
      sight. She reaches into her purse, pulls out her cell phone
      to call Tracy. It's dead.

                             MIA (CONT'D)
                No...

19    EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT

      Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. She's an
      hour-and-a-half walk from her place. She crosses roads and lots,
      navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to
      shrubbery.

A19   And then -- she hears something... Music. A piano, in the
      distance. And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well...

      Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several
      doors. Then stops. Has found where it's coming from...

      She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door...

      AND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO:

20    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began
      with. This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker.

      He passes Mia's car. She gives him the finger. He drives on,
      shaking his head...

21    OMIT

22    EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER

      Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at
      a 30's Deco building. A sign above the door: "VAN BEEK". A
      newer sub-heading below: "TAPAS & TUNES".
                               Revision                          10.



      The door opens. Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet
      stand. Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. The
      employees notice him. Recognize him. What is it with that
      guy...?

23A   OMIT

23    INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

      Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare
      walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty
      black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the
      floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the
      living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around.

                             SEBASTIAN
                You gotta stop breaking into my home.

      She looks up. She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like
      she doesn't care. This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister.

                             LAURA
                You think Mom or Dad would call this a
                home?

      Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool --

                             SEBASTIAN
                Please don't sit on that.

                             LAURA
                Are you serious?

                             SEBASTIAN
                Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool.
                The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.

                             LAURA
                I wonder why.
                       (then, rising,)
                I brought you this. It's a throw rug.

                             SEBASTIAN
                Don't need it.

                             LAURA
                Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis
                pissed on it?

                             SEBASTIAN
                That's almost insulting...
                       (then,)
                Did he?
                         Revision                        11.


She shakes her head: Unbelievable. Tosses the rug to the side.

                       LAURA
          When are you going to unpack these boxes?

                       SEBASTIAN
          When I unpack them in my club.

                       LAURA
          Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with
          you and you're stalking her.
                 (then, looks at him --)
          You're not still going by there, are you?

                       SEBASTIAN
          No.

A beat. Then --

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          They've turned it into a tapas-samba
          place. You believe that?

                       LAURA
          Seb --

                       SEBASTIAN
          Who wants to tapas while they samba?

                       LAURA
          I have someone I want you to meet.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I don't want to meet anyone.

                       LAURA
          You'll like her.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?

                       LAURA
          Probably not.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Then what are we gonna talk about?

                       LAURA
          You'll talk about the weather.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to
          meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart
          of gold.
                           Revision                      12.


                         LAURA
          Sebastian --

                       SEBASTIAN
          How long's it been?

                       LAURA
          You need to get serious. You live like a
          hermit. You're driving without insurance.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I am serious. I had a very serious plan
          for my future. It's not my fault I got
          Shanghai'ed.

                       LAURA
          You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got
          ripped off.

                       SEBASTIAN
          What's the difference?

                       LAURA
          It's not as romantic as that.
                 (she starts to walk off)
          And everyone knew that guy was shady
          except for you.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty
          word?

                       LAURA
          Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

She heads to the door. He follows her, won't give it up --

                       SEBASTIAN
          You're acting like life's got me on the
          ropes -- what you don't understand is, I
          want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life
          hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna
          make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.

Laura can't help but laugh. Stops by the door. Looks at him.

                       LAURA
          I love you. Unpack your boxes.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I'm changing the locks.
                                  Revision                       13.


                             LAURA
                       (out the door with a smile --)
                You can't afford it.

      She's gone. Sebastian thinks for a beat, then calls out --

                             SEBASTIAN
                I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!

      No reply to his triumphant declaration. He shuts the door.
      Looks again at the napkin. Thinks. Tosses it in the trash.

A23   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - LATER

      Moments later. Sebastian takes a slice of pizza from the
      fridge, pours himself some more coffee, places a Thelonious
      Monk LP onto a record player, and sits down at the piano.

      "Japanese Folk Song" -- the piece we heard in his car --
      plays...

      Sebastian plays along. Stops. Moves the record back a few
      bars. Starts it again. Plays the same passage over. Stops.
      Moves the record back a second time. Plays the passage again.
      Stops. Over and over, just like in his car -- until, finally,
      he gets it right.

      He keeps playing, louder now, and we're --

27    INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. Christmas decorations all over.
      Sebastian steps in. Immediately beelining over --

                                BOSS
                Seb.

                             SEBASTIAN
                       (putting on a smile)
                Bill. Thanks for having me back.

                             BOSS
                Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
                               Revision                       14.


                            SEBASTIAN
               Of course.
                      (under his breath as he heads
                       to the piano)
               Though I don't think they care what I
               play.

                            BOSS
               I do, and I don't want to hear the free
               jazz.

                            SEBASTIAN
               How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two
               for you, one for me?
                      (the Boss just glares)
               Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that
               works. Good deal.

     Sebastian sits down at the keys. A WAITRESS passes by.

                            WAITRESS
               Well... Welcome back.

                            SEBASTIAN
               There's a nice way to say that.

     With that -- he starts playing "Jingle Bells".

28   INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

     The restaurant's demographic has changed. It's now younger
     stragglers wandering in. Sebastian looks beyond bored. He
     finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". Zero applause.

     He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". But something seems
     to come over him now. He's restless. Slowly, his playing
     drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path...

     And then -- we hear a melody. The one Mia heard outside. The
     one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song...

     The door opens -- and Mia steps in. She sees Sebastian at the
     piano. Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND
     SEBASTIAN'S THEME]

     Gradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. We drift away
     from reality. Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as
     though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... He concludes his
     piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz
     now, as we pull back to real life...

     ...and see the Boss looking on in scorn.
                         Revision                        15.


Sebastian finishes. Silence. Mia looks like the wind has been
knocked out of her. Sebastian looks up for a second -- and
sees her. They look at one another. Just a moment.

Then -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. WE STAY ON
Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. We just see
the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. Then,
we get closer -- and realize:

                       BOSS
          ...every goddamned night.

Sebastian is silent. Then, doesn't want to have to beg but --

                       SEBASTIAN
          I'll stick to the set list, I promise --

                       BOSS
          Too late. You're done.

                       SEBASTIAN
          You're not gonna find a better player. You
          know that.

                       BOSS
                 (leans in, and --)
          Do you think anyone here gives a shit?

With that, the Boss walks off. We linger on Sebastian. Anger
giving way -- to hurt. He starts hurrying toward the door.

BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. She watches
Sebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to lay
it all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and --

                       MIA
          I just wanted to say -- I saw your
          playing, and I --

-- but Sebastian just walks right by -- his shoulder
bumping against Mia's for an added measure of disdain.

He heads out the door. Slams it shut. Mia is left standing on
her own. She looks like she's just been slapped.

SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

30   INT. AUDITION ROOMS - DAY

     Mia auditions. Pilot season cattle-call -- a series of soul-
     crushing try-outs. She's pandering to the hilt. Quick glimpses:

                            MIA (CONT'D)
               I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.
               Did you test for achromatopsia?

31   Then, a second audition --

                            MIA (CONT'D)
               D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off
               at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights.

32   And finally, a third audition --

                            MIA (CONT'D)
               This is my classroom. You don't like it,
               the door's to my left.

                            READER (O.S.)
                      (a well-dressed forty-year-old
                       WOMAN reading from sides)
               Lady why you be trippin' like that?

                            MIA
               No, Jamal. You be trippin'.



34   EXT. PARTY - DAY

     Mia wanders around another party. A BAD 80's COVER BAND plays.

                            TRACY
               There you are! You need to meet someone!
               Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.

                CARLO                           TRACY
     Nice to meet you, Mia.          He's got projects all over
                                     town.

                            CARLO
                      (shrugs, faux-modest)
               They say I have a knack for world-building.

                            MIA
                      (takes this in; then --)
               Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...
                              Revision                        17.


     She slips away. Presses toward the bar. The music gets louder,
     more obnoxious. She peers toward the band to get a look...

     And then she sees him. Sebastian.

     Playing keyboard-guitar for the band. Dressed up like his band-
     mates in a bright polyester outfit. And hating every second.

     The band finishes, and the SINGER addresses the (thin) crowd.

                            SINGER
               Alright, one more for y'all before we
               break. Do I hear any requests?

                            MIA
               "I Ran".

     Sebastian turns. Sees Mia, looking at him with a defiant grin,
     enjoying her power. He thinks -- then recognizes the face.

                            SINGER
               "I Ran" it is.
                      (to Sebastian)
               Wanna start us off, piano-man?

     Sebastian stays silent. Mortified. Finally, so reluctant, he
     taps his keyboard to count the band in and begins playing.

     On the keys, it's a single note, repeated measure after measure.
     Mia knew this. Sebastian looks at her. She smiles right back.

                            SINGER (CONT'D)
               I walked along the avenue...

35   EXT. PARTY / INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     Set break. Sebastian hurries from the keys -- enters the house,
     looks both ways, finally spots Mia and --

                            SEBASTIAN
               Ok. I remember you.

     Mia looks at him. One eyebrow raised. Yeah?

                            SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
               And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.

                            MIA
               "Curt"?

                            SEBASTIAN
               Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.
                          Revision                       18.


                       MIA
          Ok.

                       SEBASTIAN
          But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
          musician -- it's too far.

                       MIA
          My God. Did you just call yourself "a
          serious musician"?

                        SEBASTIAN
                 (beat)
          I don't think so.

                       MIA
          Can I borrow what you're wearing?

                       SEBASTIAN
          Why?

                       MIA
          Because I have an audition next week. I'm
          playing a serious fire-fighter.

                       SEBASTIAN
                 (irritation building --)
          So you're an actress. That makes sense.
          Have I seen you in anything?

                       MIA
          Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner
          Brothers lot. That's a classic.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how
          you can look down on me from all the way
          up there.

                       SINGER
                 (popping in from nowhere)
          Sebastian. Second set.

Sebastian looks at Mia. She smirks. Pleased. The Singer walks
off.

                       SEBASTIAN
          He doesn't tell me what to do.

                       MIA
          He just told you what to do.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I let him.
                              Revision                          19.


     A beat.

                            SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
               What's your name?

                            MIA
               Mia.

                            SEBASTIAN
               Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.

     He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes:

                            SINGER
               Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you
               did tonight...

36   EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT

     The party's finished. Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys,
     as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in
     the back, waiting, is Mia. She's stuck once again with CARLO,
     who's regaling her --

                            CARLO
               ...Goldilocks from the point of view of
               the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox
               and Warners are going crazy for it.

     Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys.

                            CARLO (CONT'D)
               ...We're going after Charlize. For the
               bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a
               franchise. But the thing is it's grounded.

                            MIA
                      (to Sebastian)
               George Michael!

     Sebastian stops. Looks at her. Surprised.

                            SEBASTIAN
               You again.

                            MIA
               Did you just get your keys?

     Sebastian thinks. Sees the Valet. Playing it off --

                            SEBASTIAN
               ...Yeah.
                               Revision                       20.


                            MIA
               Can you grab mine?

                            SEBASTIAN
               ...Which one is it?

                             MIA
               The Prius.

     A beat. Sebastian turns to the Valet's box. Motions to the
     Valet: Sorry. One second. Looks. All the keys are Prius keys.

                            MIA (CONT'D)
               The one with the green ribbon.

     Another beat. Sebastian finds it. Grabs it.

37   EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Mia and Sebastian trudge up a hill lined with cars. Mia aims
     her key fob. No beep. Sebastian points his own keys, also
     aiming for a beep. Silence. They've been at this for a while.

                            MIA (CONT'D)
                      (almost tripping in her heels)
               Shit...

                            SEBASTIAN
               Those look comfortable.

                            MIA
               They are...n't.

     A beat. She aims again. No beep.

                            MIA (CONT'D)
               Thank you for saving the day back there.

                            SEBASTIAN
               You didn't give me much of a choice.

                            MIA
               Strange that we keep running into each
               other.

                            SEBASTIAN
               It is strange. Maybe it means something.

                             MIA
               I doubt it.

                            SEBASTIAN
               Yeah I don't think so either.
                         Revision                        21.


On that, Mia aims again. As always -- no beep. Noticing --

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Put the clicker under your chin.

                       MIA
          What?

Sebastian demonstrates with his fob. He looks idiotic.

                       SEBASTIAN
          It turns your head into an antenna.
          Probably gives you cancer, but you find
          your car more quickly.

                       MIA
          Uh-huh.

                       SEBASTIAN
          You don't live as long, but you get
          things done faster, so it all evens out.

                       MIA
          Oh my God.

Just then, they reach a clearing -- AND THE CITY SKYLINE
APPEARS BELOW. A ribbon of lights, stretching as far as you
can see. It's the most romantic sight imaginable. They look
at each other. A beat. And then --

                       MIA (CONT'D)
          Eh.

They walk on, the lights shimmering behind.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Not much to look at.

                       MIA
          Agreed. I've seen better.

And on that -- they SING. [A LOVELY NIGHT]

Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of this
setting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alone
together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. It's
"no big deal", nothing they haven't seen or felt before --
because, after all, there's no chance for romance between
them...

Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggests
otherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes
for flats in her handbag. Sebastian sits beside her as she
slips the flats on. They look at each other, suspicious...
                         Revision                        22.


He moves his foot. She moves hers. They look at each other
again. Still suspicious...

He moves again. She moves again. They seem to be moving in
sync -- without their even wanting to...

And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost
slipped into DANCE...

Sebastian rises. Mia rises as well. The two look at each
other. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights
stretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- share
a look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW...

Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Mia
shakes her head: "Nope". They make the road their own, growing
more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find --

...that they can really dance together.

Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real
joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer
and closer, looking at each other almost giddily...

...a sound cuts through. It's a CELL PHONE ring.

Mia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench.
Snapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell.

                       MIA (CONT'D)
          Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah,
          I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...

She hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. An awkward silence. Finally --
she presses her fob again. Puts it under her chin this time. A
BEEP can be heard. They see her Prius.

                       MIA (CONT'D)
          Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride
          to your car?

                       SEBASTIAN
          No, that's fine... Thanks...

                       MIA
          ...Ok...

Not sure what else to say, she heads to her vehicle. Waves.

                       MIA (CONT'D)
          Night.

Sebastian waves back. Mia drives off. Fast. Silence...
                                 Revision                        23.


      Looking even more disappointed than he thought he'd be,
      Sebastian walks on for a bit -- then retreats back down.

A37   Comes to a stop across from the party, and we see his Riviera --
      right, it seems, where he knew it was all along. He pulls out
      his keys -- they don't have a clicker after all.

38    OMIT

39    INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

      CLOSE on --

                             CUSTOMER
                Are these pastries gluten-free?

      Mia's at work. A typically chaotic day.

                               MIA
                No...

                             CUSTOMER
                What?? I want a refund.

      Mia nods, heads to the Manager --

                             MANAGER
                You're closing up Friday.

                             MIA
                I have an audition. Remember?

                             MANAGER
                Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.

                             MIA
                But you said --

                             MANAGER
                And fix your apron.

      With that, the Manager walks off. Mia is silent for a moment
      -- wants to talk back but needs this job -- then turns -- and
      sees Sebastian at the counter.

                               MIA
                ...Hi.
                       (then)
                What are you doing here?

                             SEBASTIAN
                Meetings. Studio heads.
                               Revision                       24.


                            MIA
               Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?

                            SEBASTIAN
               Piece of cake.

     Mia looks at him. He's sweating through his shirt. A beat.

                            SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
               Actually it took me four hours and I
               ended up running. We probably have twenty
               minutes before the guy finds me. You got
               a break coming up?

     Mia laughs. A moment.

                            MIA
               I'm off in ten.

                            SEBASTIAN
               Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.

40   EXT. COFFEE SHOP / STUDIO LOT - DAY

     Mia exits, apron off. She and Sebastian start walking. She points
     across the street -- to the facade of a Parisian apartment.

                            MIA
               That's the window Ingrid Bergman and
               Humphrey Bogart looked out of in
               Casablanca.

     Sebastian nods. They start walking.

                            SEBASTIAN
               What's your Bogart's name...?
                      (Mia looks at him)
               Is it Greg?

                             MIA
               Yeah. Greg.

                            SEBASTIAN
               How long have...?

                            MIA
               We've been seeing each other for a few
               months.

     An awkward beat. They pass a wooden SALOON -- where a WESTERN
     is being shot. Extras in COWBOY costumes drink coffee on the
     steps.
                         Revision                        25.


                       MIA (CONT'D)
          I love this stuff. Makes coming to work
          easier.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I know what you mean. I get breakfast
          five miles out of the way just to sit
          outside a jazz club.

                       MIA
          Oh yeah?

                       SEBASTIAN
          It was called Van Beek. The swing bands
          played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.
                 (then,)
          It's a samba-tapas place now.

                       MIA
          A what?

                       SEBASTIAN
          Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on
          history.

Mia laughs.

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything
          and they value nothing.

They reach a patch of green. Another shoot. A P.A. yells out:

                       P.A.
          Clear the frame!

                       MIA
                 (to Sebastian)
          We need to wait here.

                       SEBASTIAN
          I know. They shoot movies on my street.
          "C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to
          sign out."

Mia laughs. A beat.

                       A.D. (O.S.)
          Quiet on set!

Mia and Sebastian watch the cameras roll. Then, in a whisper --

                       SEBASTIAN
          How'd you get into all this?
                               Revision                          26.


                             MIA
                Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an
                actress. She was in this traveling
                theater company... And there was this
                little library across the street from my
                house when I was growing up. This was
                Boulder City, Nevada -- every house
                looked exactly the same. I was ten and
                already I needed to get out. And one day,
                my aunt flew into town, and she showed me
                the library's old-movie section. We spent
                a whole day watching one after the other.
                Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.
                       (a beat; then,)
                I never knew the world was so big.

                             DIRECTOR (O.S.)
                Cut!

      Mia and Sebastian resume walking. Now, at full volume --

                             MIA
                I started putting on plays in my garage.
                I'd write the scripts and print up
                programs, and she'd give me props to use
                from wherever she'd just been -- New
                York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet
                off again and I wouldn't hear from her
                for another year.

                             SEBASTIAN
                Who would you invite to watch? Your
                parents?

                             MIA
                God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That
                would have been terrifying.

C40   CUT TO: The entrance to a giant soundstage.

                             MIA (CONT'D)
                Honestly, I wish I loved something else.
                I've tried so hard to want other things.

      She and Sebastian stop. Peer inside the stage.

                             MIA (CONT'D)
                I left school after two years to come here,
                my fourth manager just dropped me, and my
                last audition was for a teen soap pitched
                as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.
                       (a beat; then, deadpan --)
                Should've been a lawyer.
                               Revision                        27.


      They resume walking.

D40   CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the
      bright blue sky.

                             SEBASTIAN
                ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.

                             MIA
                Well it doesn't need more actresses.

                             SEBASTIAN
                You're not just an actress.

                             MIA
                What do you mean, "just an actress"?

                             SEBASTIAN
                You said it yourself, you're a child-
                prodigy playwright.

                             MIA
                That is not what I said.

                             SEBASTIAN
                You're too modest to say it but it's
                true. So you could write your own roles.
                Write something that's as interesting as
                you are.

                             MIA
                Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine
                for an open-mic night. It was horrible.

                             SEBASTIAN
                All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong
                could have played the marching-band
                charts he was given. What did he do
                instead? He made history.

                             MIA
                Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make
                history instead.

      Sebastian laughs.

                             MIA (CONT'D)
                Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's
                something I should tell you...

                             SEBASTIAN
                Yeah?
                                Revision                       28.


                              MIA
               I hate jazz.

     Sebastian stops. Turns to her.

                            SEBASTIAN
               What does that mean? "I hate jazz"?

                            MIA
               It means when I listen to it I don't like
               it.

                            SEBASTIAN
               But it's such a blanket statement. It's
               like saying "I hate animals".

                            MIA
               I do hate some animals.

                            SEBASTIAN
               Do you need to be anywhere right now?

     Mia looks at him. We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. And
     we're in --

41   INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - DAY

     -- an old-school JAZZ CLUB. It's almost empty, only aged JAZZ
     CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET...

                            SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
               Most people say they hate jazz because
               they don't have context. They don't get
               where it came from. All these people
               packed into flophouses in New Orleans,
               speaking five different languages, and
               jazz was how they talked to each other.

                            MIA
               I thought it was just Kenny G.

                              SEBASTIAN
               ...What?

     Mia looks at him. Already knows just how to get to him.

                            MIA
               I associate it with facials. It's
               relaxing.

                            SEBASTIAN
               It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a
               gunfight `cause somebody told him he
               played a wrong note!
                         Revision                           29.


                       MIA
                 (laying it on thick)
          Right, but it's good to talk over. Where
          I grew up there's this jazz station
          they'd play at cocktail parties whenever
          they served the salami and cheese.

                       SEBASTIAN
          Mia. These are things you can't unsay.

She bursts into laughter. Sebastian points to the band --

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          It's not cocktail music -- it's a high-
          wire act. These guys are performing and
          composing and rearranging all at once.

A beat. Mia looks at the band. We DRIFT over the instruments...

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          That's why you need to be in the space
          and see what's at stake. This whole thing
          -- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll
          head off to cut commercial sessions or do
          pit at the Pantages `cause they have to --
          but when I have my own place -- my club --
          they'll play whatever they want.

Mia looks at Sebastian. Her laughter has subsided. She can
see something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of...

                       MIA
          Your club?

                       SEBASTIAN
          ...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm
          getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.

He watches the band. Lost in the sound. Then -- sincere --

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          The world tells everyone to move on. Says
          the music's had its moment. But I love it
          too much. I'm not moving on.

The band finishes. The ride cymbal sizzles in the air...

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          So?

He looks at Mia. She's visibly moved.

Just then -- we hear a BEEP. Mia looks at her phone.
                                Revision                      30.


42   INT. SIDE CORRIDOR - LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - CONTINUOUS

                            MIA
               Hi, I just missed a call...

43   INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - MOMENTS LATER

     Mia steps out, dazed. Sebastian's listening to a new tune. He
     spots Mia, turns to her -- as, shouting over the music --

                            MIA (CONT'D)
               I got a call-back!

                            SEBASTIAN
               Really? For what?

                            MIA
               That show I told you about.

                            SEBASTIAN
               Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?

                            MIA
               Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel
               Without a Cause.

                            SEBASTIAN
               That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!"

     Mia laughs. But Sebastian can tell something in her laugh...

                            SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
               You've seen it, right?

                            MIA
               Obviously.
                      (a beat; then --)
               No.

                            SEBASTIAN
               What? You're the movie person.

                            MIA
               It's the one I lie about.

                            SEBASTIAN
               Come on. You can't do this audition and
               never see Rebel. The theater near me's
               playing it. If you want -- I can take
               you. For research.

                              MIA
                        (considering this)
               ...Ok.
                              Revision                          31.


                            SEBASTIAN
               10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?

                            MIA
               Ok.
                      (another nod, taking it in)
               For research.

     Mia looks at him -- he looks at her -- each of them
     suppressing a newfound giddiness... And on that --

44   EXT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - EVENING

     Mia and Sebastian exit. Wave "good-bye". We FOLLOW Sebastian.
     He rounds the corner, nears the Hermosa Beach pier...

     ...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange
     new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. The feeling
     that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love...

     He gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. Dances with an OLD
     COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a
     dream. There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure
     if this dream will sustain. But for now, it's a beautiful
     feeling...

     The MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT.

45   EXT. AUDITION BUILDING - DAY

     A Pasadena building. As Mia approaches the door, another cell
     ring. It's her MOM. This time, Mia is happy to get the call:

                            MIA (CONT'D)
               Hi, Mom!

                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               Hi, sweetie. How are you?

                            MIA
               Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.

                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               Oh my God! You're going to be on TV??

                            MIA
               Well -- it's not picked up yet.

                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               Not picked up?

                            MIA
               First they make the pilot, then if they
               like the pilot it goes on TV.
                              Revision                           32.


                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               And you're in the pilot?

                            MIA
               Well, no, I have a call-back.

                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               I see... Didn't you audition for a TV
               thing last week?

                            MIA
               It's another audition.

                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               I see... So you might get a role in a
               thing that might one day be put on TV...

                            MIA
               ...Well when you put it like that it
               sounds like a huge accomplishment.

                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting.
               What channel? ABC? HBO?

                            MIA
               Oxygen.

                            MIA'S MOM (O.S.)
               Oxygen?

                            MIA
               You know what, I have to go. I love you.

     She hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Enters the building.
